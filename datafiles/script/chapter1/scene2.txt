~bg, foyer

~char, narrator
Noa stepped through a landmine of miscellaneous items scattered throughout Jo Anne’s foyer. 

~char, noa
~pose, 0
Why do you have all this junk lying around?

~char, joanne
Oh, child. It’s not junk you see lying around. These are possessions of potential purpose.

~char, narrator
Jo Anne picked up some torn wrapping paper with a candy cane pattern and a ball of earth-tone yarn.

~char, noa
It looks like clutter. What do you use any of this for?

~char, narrator
Jo Anne set aside the wrapping paper and looked around for another example. She gave up.

~char, joanne
Come with me.
It will be easier to just show you.

~bg, artroom

~char, narrator
Noa stepped into an art room with a large sculpture as its centerpiece. The sculpture was as colorful as it was complicated. One might even describe it as a contraption.

~char, noa
Oh, wow. You made this?

~char, narrator
Jo Anne followed Noa into the art room.

~char, joanne
~pose, 1
Yes, pupil! Good eye.
~pose, 0
Sculptures like this bring love to lost items.

~char, noa
How did you even think to use some of these things?

~char, narrator
Noa pointed to an empty crayon box. The cardboard had been deconstructed to give it a new shape.

~char, joanne
These things needed love.

~char, narrator
Noa chuckled.

~char, noa
~pose, 1
How can you tell if a thing “needs love?”

~char, joanne
~pose, 0
I’ll show you, pupil. Follow me outside.

~bg, backyard

~char, narrator
Jo Anne guided Noa to her back yard, lush with blooming flowers and vibrant plantlife.

~char, joanne
Take note of the hues that inspire you. Contrast is good.
