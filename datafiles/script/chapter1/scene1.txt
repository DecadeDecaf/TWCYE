…and done!
Let me get the mirror so you can see it better.

~char, narrator
Gabby left the room and returned with a small mirror.
Noa spent a few moments looking at her newly-dyed hair.

~char, noa
I like it. The red streak looks really cool.
Thanks, mom.

~char, gabby
Of course! Your hair looks a bit more like mine now, doesn’t it?

~char, noa
~pose, 0
Yeah, it does.
Have you ever dyed your hair?

~char, gabby
Oh, no. Never.

~char, noa
Hm. How come my hair isn’t naturally black like yours? Were you blonde when you were my age?

~char, narrator
Gabby paused.

Uh — hm — no, I wasn’t.
Maybe we should ask your dad about this.

~char, noa

I don’t know. Maybe.
