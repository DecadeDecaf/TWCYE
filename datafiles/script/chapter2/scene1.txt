What’s there to be nervous about?

~pose, 2
I don’t know. Everything.

~char, narrator
Noa looked at her hands. She was visibly shaking.
Gabby pulled Noa into a hug. Noa started crying.

~char, gabby
Oh, sweetie. It’s okay; it’s okay. We’ll fight this together.
Do you want to go to a doctor after school and talk about it?

~char, noa
I think so. Yes.

~char, narrator
Gabby continued hugging Noa for a long time, until Noa broke the silence.

~char, noa

Does anxiety run in the family?

~char, gabby
I’m not sure, Noa. I’m not sure.

~char, noa
…because one time grandma said that she gets anxiety. Maybe that passed down to me.

~char, gabby
Hm. I think everyone gets anxiety. It doesn’t have to be hereditary.
Are you ready for school now?

~char, noa
Yeah. I guess.
