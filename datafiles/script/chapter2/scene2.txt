This is all so overwhelming. I don’t know what to do.

~char, narrator
Jo Anne embraced Noa in her arms, hugging tightly and stroking her hair.

~char, noa
I can’t think straight.

~char, joanne
shhh…

~char, narrator
Jo Anne continued silently hugging Noa.

~char, joanne
I can’t feel you breathing, youngster. Remember to breathe.

~char, noa
Okay.

~char, narrator
Noa performed a few deep, audible breaths.
One… Two… Three…

Let your mind rest. It deserves the nap, you know.

~char, noa
I’ll try.

~char, narrator
Four… Five…
Noa slowly freed herself from the hug.

~char, noa
Do you have any more sculptures? Or is it just the one?

~char, joanne
Of course, child. Would you like to see another?

~char, noa
Yes, please.

~bg, garage

~char, narrator
Jo Anne guided Noa towards the garage. In the far corner stood a sculpture similar to the previous one, except more metallic. It had lots of moving parts.
Noa put her hand up to a Newton’s Cradle with the base removed. The strings were attached to the back of a spade’s handle, leaving the balls suspended high above the floor.
Noa lifted the ball closest to her and then let go, initiating the lengthy yet satisfying back-and-forth motion.
Noa looked back at Jo Anne and apologized.

~char, noa
Sorry for touching it.

~char, joanne
~pose, 1
No, please. Keep observing. This is good. Perception is a good skill to have, pupil.

~char, noa

How did you find the stuff for this one? It’s all so fidgety.

~char, joanne
These things needed a different kind of love. These things needed calm.

~char, noa
…and how can you tell if a thing “needs calm?”

~char, joanne
First, slow down. Only then can you notice all the little motions of the world.
