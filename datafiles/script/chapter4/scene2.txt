I can’t face her.

~char, joanne
Why not?

~char, noa
She has lied to me for my entire life.

~char, joanne
What about?

~char, noa
…being my mom.

~char, joanne

Oh, child. That’s just the thing. She @FBis@FR your mom.

~char, noa
~pose, 2
No she’s not! You are!

~char, joanne

No, I think of myself as more an incubator.

~char, noa
Gross.

~char, joanne
All I did was bring you into this world. Gabby — she raised you, child.

~char, noa
Then why would she and dad keep this secret from me?

~char, joanne
Maybe she was worried that you wouldn’t see her in the same way.
But you need to understand something, pupil. She loves you.

~char, noa
~pose, 2
Do you @FBnot@FR love me?

~char, joanne

I love you more than anything, child. You are everything to me.

~char, noa

Then — why don’t you have custody over me?
~pose, 2
Where have you been all this time?

~char, narrator
Jo Anne sighed.

~char, joanne
Gabby makes money. I make art. I’m not exactly in the best position to care for you.
~pose, 1
But I promise you — I love you.

~char, noa
~pose, 0
Can you also promise me that you’ll stay in my life?

~char, joanne
~pose, 2
Of course. I will always be here for you.
~pose, 0
But please, child. Give Gabby another chance. She cares so deeply about you.

~char, noa
Okay. I will.
~pose, 1
Thanks, not-mom.

~char, narrator
Jo Anne laughed.

~char, joanne
You can call me Jo Anne, pupil.
